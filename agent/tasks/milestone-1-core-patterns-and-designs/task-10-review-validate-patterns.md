# Task 10: Review and Validate All Patterns

**Milestone**: [M1 - Core Patterns and Designs](../milestones/milestone-1-core-patterns-and-designs.md)
**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours
**Dependencies**: Tasks 1-9 (all pattern and design creation tasks)
**Status**: Not Started

---

## Objective

Review all created patterns and design documents to ensure completeness, accuracy, consistency, and adherence to ACP standards.

---

## Context

This final task ensures all patterns and designs are production-ready, accurate, and follow ACP conventions. It's a quality gate before moving to Milestone 2.

---

## Steps

### 1. Review All Pattern Files

Check each pattern file in `agent/patterns/` for:
- Completeness (all sections filled)
- Accuracy (code examples are correct)
- Consistency (similar structure across patterns)
- ACP template compliance

### 2. Verify Code Examples

For each pattern:
- Check TypeScript syntax
- Verify imports are correct
- Ensure examples are runnable
- Test code snippets if possible

### 3. Check Pattern Generalizability

Ensure patterns are:
- Generic (no project-specific references)
- Reusable across different projects
- Not tied to specific implementations
- Applicable to various use cases

### 4. Review Design Documents

Check `agent/design/` documents for:
- Comprehensive coverage
- Clear explanations
- Proper structure
- ACP design template compliance

### 5. Cross-Reference with Requirements

Verify all patterns align with:
- requirements.md specifications
- Reference project implementations
- Best practices

### 6. Check Internal Links

Ensure all links between documents work:
- Pattern cross-references
- Milestone links
- Task links

### 7. Verify Anti-Patterns

Ensure anti-patterns are documented where applicable.

### 8. Check Examples

Verify all examples are:
- Clear and understandable
- Properly formatted
- Syntactically correct
- Relevant to the pattern

### 9. Update Milestone Success Criteria

Mark completed success criteria in milestone-1-core-patterns-and-designs.md.

### 10. Create Summary Report

Document:
- Total patterns created
- Total design documents created
- Any issues found and resolved
- Recommendations for Milestone 2

---

## Verification

- [ ] All pattern files reviewed
- [ ] Code examples verified
- [ ] Patterns are generic and reusable
- [ ] Design documents reviewed
- [ ] Cross-references checked
- [ ] Anti-patterns documented
- [ ] Examples verified
- [ ] Milestone success criteria updated
- [ ] Summary report created
- [ ] All issues resolved

---

## Notes

This task is critical for ensuring quality before moving to Milestone 2. Take time to thoroughly review each pattern and design document.
